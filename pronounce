<FONT SIZE=2> * <b> pronunciation guide </b> for
first name: "u" is pronounced as in the first "u" in "aluminum"
("aluminium" if you are not American). If you pretend the "a" in
"Murali" is silent, you're pretty much on the money (strictly
speaking, the "a" leads to a quick "uh" sound, i.e., the pronunciation
is Mu-ruh-lee, but this is so subtle that it's worth ignoring.) <br> <br> For the 
last name, pronounce "Huh-run", with the emphasis on the first
syllable.  </FONT> <br> <br>
