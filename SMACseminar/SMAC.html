<b> Guidelines for SMAC talks: </b>
<ol> 
<LI> While stochastic modeling and computing are of particular interest, a much broader list of topics have been discussed in this series. Any talk that has a statistics challenge and/or interesting data sets is welcome, even if the statistical challenge is yet to be solved! 
<LI> 40 minutes for each talk + 10 minutes for discussion.
<LI> The talk should be accessible to all grad students who have completed 1 year of the program.
<LI> Informal style. For instance, chalk and blackboard talks are welcome. Incomplete/ongoing research projects are encouraged.
<LI> Interruptions during the talk are welcome but they should only be for clarifications; longer questions are to be left to the discussion period.
<LI> Unpublished work may not be shared or discussed outside the group without the permission of the speaker.
