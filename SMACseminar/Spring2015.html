<center> <FONT SIZE=5> Stochastic Modeling and Computational Statistics, Spring 2015 </FONT> <br></center>

This discussion series will be held <b> Fridays 10am-11am </b> in Thomas 327. <br> <br>
Guidelines:
<ol> 
<LI> 40 minutes for each talk + 20 minutes for discussion.
<LI> The talk should be accessible to all grad students who have completed 1 year of the program.
<LI> Informal style. For instance, chalk and blackboard talks are welcome.
<LI> Interruptions during the talk are welcome (they are a mainstay of SMAC seminars!) but they should only be for clarifications; longer questions are to be left to the discussion period.
<LI> Unpublished work may not be shared or discussed outside the group without the permission of the speaker/author.
</ol> 

Unless otherwise noted, all speakers are from the Department of Statistics at Penn State University.
