<TITLE> Stochastic Modeling and Computational Statistics, Fall 2013  </TITLE>
<FONT SIZE=5> Stochastic Modeling and Computational Statistics, Fall 2013 </FONT> <br>

This seminar and discussion series will be held <b> Fridays 10am-11am </b>(note the new timings) in Thomas 327. <br> <br>

Guidelines:
<ol> 
<LI> 40 minutes for each talk + 20 minutes for discussion.
<LI> The talk should be accessible to all grad students who have completed 1 year of the program.
<LI> Informal style. For instance, chalk and blackboard talks are welcome.
<LI> Interruptions during the talk are welcome but they should only be for clarifications; longer questions are to be left to the discussion period.
<LI> Unpublished work may not be shared or discussed outside the group without the permission of the speaker/author.
<LI> While a large proportion of the talks may be related to stochastic modeling and computing, a much broader list of topics have also been discussed in this series.
