<TITLE>`Not the best movies' list </TITLE>

<H>Movies I dislike (but am supposed to like)</H>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>
The English Patient
<LI>
La Strada. A Fellini 'masterpiece'.
<LI>
Gangs of New York. Alright, so Daniel Day-Lewis was brilliant, but it's still a pretty bad movie.
<LI>
All James Bond movies
<LI>
Kill Bill
<LI>
Crash 
<LI>
Braveheart. Plot summary: Really bad people do very bad things to honest, decent (and romantic) people. Lots of blood and gore. Boo! These good people take revenge. Lots of blood and gore, hooray! Good people get killed in the end... but they still have their pride. More blood and gore.

<LI>
Water.  The story surrounding this Deepa Mehta film on the treatment of widows in India is much more interesting than the film itself. Hard to imagine that the director of a movie like "Earth" could have made this film.
<LI>
Saving Private Ryan.

<H>Overrated movies (not terrible, but I don't think they are as great as most people seem to think)</H>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> 
Million Dollar Baby: Yes, we get it. Clint Eastwood has a gruff exterior but a heart of gold. 
<LI>
Star Wars: I saw it first as an adult; it was too late.
<LI>
Schindler's List
<LI>
The Matrix
<LI>
Guess Who's Coming to Dinner
<LI>
Gran Torino: Yes, we get it. Clint Eastwood may have aged, but he still has a gruff exterior with a heart of gold.
