    If they are doing interdisciplinary research, are they making sure that they have papers in both the disciplinary journals as well as in statistics/methods journals?
    What are they doing for visibility? Are they giving talks at conferences, universities? Should they reach out to people in order to make this happen? 


(2) Teaching/mentoring:

    Are they doing well with teaching or struggling in any way? Could they use some help from colleagues? College of Science experts? Workshops?
    Are they advising grads? Do they need help with recruiting students? Any troubles? 


(3) Service:

    What kind of service are they doing for the department/college/university?
    Are they engaged in departmental activities, are they playing a leadership role? (This is particularly important for associate professors)
    Are they engaged in service for the profession, e.g. ASA officer, organizing workshops, editorial/referee work etc.? 


(4) Broader questions:
