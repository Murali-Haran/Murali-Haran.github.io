<H>Movies/t.v. shows that are so bad, they're good (for laughs) </H>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI> Fair Game starring Cindy Crawford and Billy Baldwin.  Cindy
Crawford plays a tough lawyer. Billy Baldwin plays a tough cop who is
assigned to protect her. As if the premise weren't bad enough, the
truly awful dialogue and acting pushes this from just bad to 'so bad
it's good'.

<LI> Lots of Hindi films. Formulaic to the extreme, and
unintentionally campy. Even Hindi film titles lack imagination. These
days many titles are borrowed from old Hindi film song lyrics or
consist of a hodge-podge of Hindi and English, as spoken by upper
class big city teenagers ( Hindi examples: "Mr Hot Mr Kool",
"Provoked, A True Story", "Shaka Laka Boom Boom". The ones with
Hindi-English mixed up are even funnier. the American equivalent would
be Hollywood films with titles like "Whatever", or "BFF, Best Friends
Forever").

<LI> "Walker, Texas Ranger" (t.v. series) Plot lines that an
intelligent 12 year old would be embarrassed to claim as his
own. Chuck Norris is so tough, he'll make you laugh uncontrollably.

<LI> "Diagnosis Murder" I've only seen 1 episode of this, but I've
seen enough and heard enough (from a friend) to know that this show
has plot lines that don't try very hard to make sense. (Murdering a
fellow caterer to boost your business? Talk about shaky motives...)
And Dick van Dyke is so affable, that it's pleasant to watch when
you're not doubled over, laughing at the contrived scenarios.

<LI> Any made-for-t.v. film that's all about showing some skin.  Even
 funnier when the sex scenes are edited out, as they are on HBO
 Bangladesh (I'm not making this up).

<LI> "Harley Davidson, Marlboro Man". With the exception of The Diner,
probably all Mickey Rourke films fall into the "so bad it's good
category".  And with a title like that...
