<LI> hey, just wondering if you could break down my grade for me, like what i got in each part. thanks. <br> <br>

<LI> 
I just wanted to let you know that I will not be in class tomorrow either. I
need to go home and get better.

A beautifully worded formal exchange: <br>

Would I be able to make up the quiz and the lab?

NAME,
You can make up the quiz by showing up to take it tomorrow at 11am. As 
for the lab, it is already on the course website so you can print it out 
and work on it. Ask the T.A. (Muhammad, mxa934@psu.edu) or me for help 
if and when you need it.

I actually have counseling tomorrow morning. Is there any other time
that I could make up the quiz?

1:45pm tomorrow. MH

I have class...I won't be free until around 4 tomorrow.
