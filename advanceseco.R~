## read in the data (sep=" "  just means that the columns are separated by white space)
surftemp = read.table("http://www.stat.psu.edu/~mharan/spatial/datasets/atmosphNASA/surftemp1.dat",sep=" ")

## find the dimensions of the data set
dim(surftemp)
## (it should say 576  3, which means it is a 576 x 3 data matrix

## now, take a look at the data
## interpolate the data
surftemp.interp = interp(surftemp[,1],surftemp[,2],surftemp[,3])
image(surftemp.interp)
## You can save the above plot into any format you like (that you can later insert into a document)
## by clicking on the File-> Save as menu
contour(surftemp.interp, add=T)
## You can save this contour plot in the same way

## IF YOU ARE USING UNIX/LINUX: 
## now, to save these plots into image files (that you can later insert into a document)
pdf("imageplot.pdf")
image(surftemp.interp)
dev.off()
pdf("contourplot.pdf")
contour(surftemp.interp, add=T)
dev.off()

## if you don't like pdf or run into problems with pdf, you can create jpg files instead
jpeg("imageplot.jpg")
image(surftemp.interp)
dev.off()
jpeg("contourplot.jpg")
contour(surftemp.interp, add=T)
dev.off()

## Simple summaries of the data values (the 3rd column, which is all surface temperature values across
## the 576 different locations)
summary(surftemp[,3])  # summary provides simple summary statistics for the 3rd column of the data matrix
hist(surftemp[,3])  # hist provides a histogram for the 3rd column of the data matrix
