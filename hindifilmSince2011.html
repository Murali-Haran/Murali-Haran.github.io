<b> Hind films watched since July 2011 </b>

<li> Delhi-6: I didn't care for the film's heavy-handed attempt at
conveying a confused message about belonging and religious intolerance
and I was also surprised by the performance of Abhishek Bachchan -- much
too self-absorbed and camera-conscious to be a competent actor.
Still, I really liked that they tried to make a movie that was a little
different, and I appreciated the fact that some of the supporting
actors were excellent. "Masakali" and "Genda Phool" were quite catchy
songs, and I enjoyed the filming of the Chandni Chowk area in Delhi.
Although it had its faults, I thought it was a watchable movie and had
 interesting moments and its share of good actors.

<li> Cheeni Kum: Romance between a 64 year old grouchy chef (Amitabh Bachchan) and a 34 year old woman (Tabu). Tabu is always charming and AB was good in this film as well. Paresh Rawal was entertaining as Tabu's father. A different kind of Hindi movie, and though melodramatic at times, pretty decent overall.
