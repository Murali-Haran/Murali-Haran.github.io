<H2>What Do You Care ?</H2>

<P><PRE>
(Pratik Patel)

What do you care? 
As I walk the cold 
Streets with an air
Of contempt too old

The young women married
With looks wasted
Worried and harried
Their lives hasted

The poverty lines
The gilded streets
The city's spine
With painful beats

What do you care?
I ask the dirt
Snow thick air
Bone-chilling hurt

What do you care?
Empty thoughts despair
Mr. Millionaire?
What do you care?

What do you care?
What do you care?
You stinkin' town
What do you care?
