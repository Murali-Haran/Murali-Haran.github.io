<P><PRE>I Think I Love You
The Partridge family

I'm sleeping<br>And right in the middle of a good
dream<br>Then all at once I wake up<br>From something that keeps
knocking at my brain<br>Before I go insane<br>I hold my pillow to my
head<br>And spring up in my bed<br>Screaming out the words I dread
....<br>"I think I love you!" (I think I love you)<br><br>This
morning, I woke up with this feeling<br>I didn't know how to deal
with<br>And so I just decided to myself<br>I'd hide it to
myself<br>And never talk about it<br>And did not go and shout
it<br>When you walked into the room .....<br>"I think I love you!" (I
think I love you)<br><br>I think I love you<br>So what am I so afraid
of?<br>I'm afraid that I'm not sure of<br>A love there is no cure
for<br>I think I love you<br>Isn't that what life is made
of?<br>Though it worries me to say<br>I've never felt this
way<br><br>I don't know what I'm up against<br>I don't know what it's
all about<br>I've go so much to think about<br>Hey! I think I love
you!<br>So what am I so afraid of?<br>I'm afraid that I'm not sure
of<br>A love there is no cure for<br>I think I love you<br>Isn't that
what life is made of?<br>Though it worries me to say<br>I've never
felt this way<br><br>Believe me<br>You really don't have to worry<br>I
only want to make you happy<br>And if you say<br>Hey, go away, I
will<br>But I think better still<br>I'd better stay around and love
you<br>Do you think I have a case?<br>Let me ask you to your
face<br>Do you think you love me?<br><br>"I think I love you!" (I
think I love you)<br><br>"I think I love you!" (I think I love
you)<br><br>"I think I love you!" (I think I love you)<br><br>"I think
I love you!" (I think I love you)<br><br>"I think I love you!" (I
think I love you)<br><br><a
