<H2>Boring </H2>

<P><PRE> Boring
(Pratik Patel)

The world seems boring to me

Wandering the streets

Without any treats

Just vapid thoughts and feet

Sore from the day's heat

No pretty face to meet

Nor butter on wheat

Not even a seat

But the end of the street

Reveals nothing complete

My pencil so beat

On paper not neat

I record what I see
