<H2>Dennis Leary on Happiness</H2>

God.. "I'm just not happy. I'm just not happy. I'm just not happy because my
life didn't turn out the way I thought it would." Hey! Join the fucking club,
ok!? I thought I was going to be the starting center fielder for the Boston
Red Socks. Life sucks, get a fucking helmet, allright?! "I'm not happy. I'm
not happy." Nobody's happy, ok!? Happiness comes in small doses folks. It's a
cigarette, or a chocolate cookie, or a five second orgasm. That's it, ok! You
cum, you eat the cookie, you smoke the butt, you go to sleep, you get up in
the morning and go to fucking work, ok!? That is it! End of fucking list!
