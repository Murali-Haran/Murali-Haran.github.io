<H2>I Sing the Body Electric </H2>

<P><PRE> by Walt Whitman

To be with those I like is enough,
    To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,
    To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough

    I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in the sea
    All things please the soul, but these things please the soul well.
