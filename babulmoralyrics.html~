    je baabul ghar aapano, mai chali piya ke des 


    O father, I depart forcibly from my home
    Four men gathered to lift my palanquin {see the wedding/funeral analogy here?}
    my loved ones will become strangers
    the innermost portals of my home will be unreachable
    as I leave my father's home and go to my husband's country.
