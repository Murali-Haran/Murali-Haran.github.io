One of the reasons I dislike the academy awards is because of the meaningless, boring speeches that people make thanking everyone for hours together.

Now it's my turn to make a hopefully less boring but definitely very
meaningful speech thanking so many people.

Lucky to have such wonderful parents and sister. 

Lucky to have some truly wonderful friends.

Lucky to have so many warm and loving athais, athimbers, mamas, mamis, Patti, 
and cousins.

And now, I am lucky to have Jennifer...

Her parents and sisters have also welcomed me into their family.

However, I am a greedy person. I wish Thathi (my grandmother) and Thatha (my grandfather) were still around to be part of this.

Thathi would have simply hugged me and Jennifer and flashed one of her famous smiles and said "eyh".

If only Thatha (my grandfather) were here, he would have said:
"Murali, I am so very happy. Jennifer is a fine girl. And very beautiful!"
