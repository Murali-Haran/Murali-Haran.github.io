<center><h3>Tenure-Track Faculty Positions<br>
Department of Statistics<br>
The Pennsylvania State University
</h3></center>

The Department of Statistics at Penn State seeks 
to fill multiple tenure-track/tenured positions,
at any level, to begin August 2013.
Screening will begin November 15, 2012.

<p>
In addition to its core strengths in likelihood theory,
nonparametrics, computational methods, multivariate analysis, and
other statistical topics, Penn State's Department of Statistics
maintains numerous productive interdisciplinary relationships and
boasts strong administrative support for nurturing these
relationships.  These interdisciplinary initiatives, each of which
involves multiple statistics faculty members, include
the <a href="http://astrostatistics.psu.edu/" target="_blank"> Center
for Astrostatistics </a>, <a href="http://www.bx.psu.edu/"
target="_blank"> Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics</a>,
Statistical Ecology and Environmental
Statistics, <a href="http://www.cidd.psu.edu/" target="_blank"> Center
for Infectious Disease Dynamics </a>, and
<a href="http://statgen.psu.edu/"  target="_blank"> Statistical Genetics</a>, along
with the <a href="http://methodology.psu.edu/"  target="_blank"> Methodology
Center </a> and the
 <a href="http://stat.psu.edu/consulting"  target="_blank"> Statistical Consulting Center</a>.  In addition, multiple statistics
faculty currently actively collaborate with faculty in the College of
Information Sciences and Technology and the College of Earth and
Mineral Sciences (specifically the world-renowned departments of
meteorology, geosciences, and geology) at Penn State.

<p>
The Pennsylvania State University is located in the center of the state, 
in a valley surrounded by the Appalachian Mountains and state forest land.
The adjoining town of State College is located within 250 miles of
New York City, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Pittsburgh.
It offers excellent public schools, easy access to outdoor recreation, and
many of the amenities of a metropolitan area&mdash;first-rate 
public transportation, world-class theater and concert events, 
advanced technology and research facilities&mdash;without the 
attending stress of urban life.
