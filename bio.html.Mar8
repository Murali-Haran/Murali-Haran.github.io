I am currently Assistant Professor at the <A HREF="http://www.stat.psu.edu/"> Department of Statistics </A>, Pennsylvania State University.

I have an M.S. and Ph.D. in Statistics from the <A
HREF="http://www.stat.umn.edu/"> School of Statistics </A> , <A
HREF="http://www1.umn.edu/tc"> University of Minnesota </A>,
Minneapolis, MN (June 2003), and I was a postdoctoral fellow at the <A
HREF="http://www.niss.org/"> National Institute of Statistical
Sciences </A>, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina (2003-2004). I
graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and minors in Statistics and
Film from <A HREF="http://www.scs.cmu.edu/"> Carnegie Mellon University
</A>, Pittsburgh, PA. (May 1997).  <BR><br>

My research interests include Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms and
hierarchical models for spatial data. I am interested in
interdisciplinary research and have worked with environmental
scientists at the <a href="http://enhs.umn.edu/"> School of Public Health</a>, University of Minnesota and
have recently begun multiple collaborations at Penn State with:
<UL>
<LI> <a href="http://www.geog.psu.edu/"> Geography </a> on studying how ecological factors can impact coastal aquatic ecosystems.
<LI> <a href="http://www.met.psu.edu/"> Meteorology </a> on using large spatiotemporal data sets (e.g. from large oceanic observation systems) to learn about indicators of climate change.
<LI> <a href="http://www.ppath.cas.psu.edu/"> Plant Pathology </a> on estimating risks of crop epidemics.
</UL>
I have also worked with computer scientists on statistical issues in
software engineering.  <br> <br>

I was jointly advised by <L1> <A
HREF="http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke"> Luke Tierney</A>* and <L1> <A
HREF="http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~brad"> Brad Carlin</A>** on my
dissertation <b>Efficient Perfect and MCMC Sampling Methods for
Bayesian Spatial and Components of Variance Models</b>.  I worked on
Bayesian computation for spatial models and some hierarchical
models. In particular, I investigated sampling techniques for
hierarchical models that use Gaussian Markov Fields (GMRFs). A major
portion of my thesis contains work on perfect sampling approaches for
Bayesian disease mapping models. For more on perfect sampling, see
D.B.Wilson's <A Href = "http://dbwilson.com/exact/"> website </A>.
While in graduate school, I also studied hierarchical Bayesian
modeling techniques used for disease mapping and particulate matter
exposure studies.
