¡ÈI Sing the Body Electric¡É, by Walt Whitman

    ¡ÄTo be with those I like is enough,
    To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,
    To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough¡Ä
    I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in the sea¡Ä
    All things please the soul, but these things please the soul well.
