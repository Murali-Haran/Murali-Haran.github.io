Always start with a simple example, get everything right for the example
(theory, computing, simulations etc.) before moving on to something bigger
and more complicated.

Write up what you are working on periodically, generally at least once every
two weeks. Even if the work does not make it into a paper, it helps organize
and clarify your thoughts. If the work makes it into a paper, writing
periodically will have saved you lots of time.
