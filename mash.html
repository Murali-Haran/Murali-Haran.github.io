<P><PRE>Suicide is Painless (Mash Theme Song)
(Mike Altman and Johnny Mandel)

Through early morning fog I see
Visions of the things to be,
The pains that are withheld for me,
I realize and I can see...

        That suicide is painless,
        It brings on many changes
        And I can take or leave it if I please.

The game of life is hard to play,
I'm going to loose it anyway,
The loosin' card I'll someday lay;
So this is all I have to say...

        That suicide is painless,
        It brings on many changes
        And I can take or leave it if I please.

The only way to win is cheat
And lay it down before I'm beat
And to another give my seat
For that's the only painless feat.

        That suicide is painless,
        It brings on many changes
        And I can take or leave it if I please.
        And you can do the same thing if you please.
