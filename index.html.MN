I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the 
<A HREF="http://www.niss.org/">  National Institute of Statistical Sciences </A>, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. I will be at <A HREF="http://www.stat.psu.edu"> Pennsylvania State University </A> starting August, 2004. <BR><BR>

I have a Ph.D. in Statistics from the <A
HREF="http://www.stat.umn.edu/"> School of Statistics </A> , <A
HREF="http://www1.umn.edu/tc"> University of Minnesota </A>,
Minneapolis, MN (June 2003).  I graduated with a B.S. in Computer
Science and minors in Statistics and Film from <A
HREF="http://www.cmu.edu/"> Carnegie Mellon University </A>,
Pittsburgh, PA. (May 1997). I received an M.S. in Statistics from the
University of Minnesota (June 2001). <BR><BR>I was jointly advised by
<L1> <A HREF="http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke"> Luke Tierney </A> and
<L1> <A HREF="http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~brad"> Brad Carlin </A> on
my dissertation <b>Efficient Perfect and MCMC Sampling Methods for
Bayesian Spatial and Components of Variance Models</b>.  I worked on
Bayesian computation for spatial models and some hierarchical
models. In particular, I investigated sampling techniques for
hierarchical models that use Gaussian Markov Fields (GMRFs). A major
portion of my thesis contains work on perfect sampling approaches for
Bayesian disease mapping models. For more information on perfect
sampling, see <A Href = "http://dbwilson.com/exact/"> D.B.Wilson's
website </A>.  I also studied hierarchical Bayesian modeling
techniques used for disease mapping and particulate matter exposure
studies.  <BR><BR> The following paper contains some results from
research in MCMC block sampling techniques for GMRFs.  <BR> <BR> <LI>

Among other research interests I would like to pursue in the future are:
spatial modeling, prior elicitation and measurement error modeling.
