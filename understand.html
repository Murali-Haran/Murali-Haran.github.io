<TITLE>Understanding Seminars</TITLE>

<H2>A few sufficient conditions (for me) to understand most of a statistics seminar </H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI> 
There should be fewer than 25 slides per hour, (around 0.42 slides/min). If the slides are sparse or several have graphics, this number may go up, but never beyond 40.

<LI>
The speaker should repeatedly remind me about the goal of the talk: what is the problem being solved, and what are the issues?

<LI>
The speaker should repeatedly remind me about notation: by slide 14, it is hard to remember the notation introduced briefly on slide 3.

<LI>
There should never be more than two major ideas discussed in a talk (just one major idea is even better).

<LI>
There should never be more than two theorems in a talk (one can refer to more, but only in passing).

<LI>
The speaker should not obscure my view of the slides.

<LI>
No proof details should be part of the talk though a rough outline of the argument/proof may be very useful.

<H2>Additional conditions (for me) to understand a statistics seminar COMPLETELY </H2>
<LI> 
I should have studied a related topic for at least a month at some point during my life, and preferably have tried to do my own research in a similar area.

<LI>
I should have heard the same talk in some form before.
