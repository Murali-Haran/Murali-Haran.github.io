Hey Pratik,
Happy 30th birthday yo!!! I know it's late, but just think of this entire year as a celebration of your 30th (like countries celebrating their centennial for an entire year).

Yo Petet,
It's a jungle out there, so enjoy the good times at home with Adrian Monk.
As our Prez said "this reminds me of the importance of being a mom..."
