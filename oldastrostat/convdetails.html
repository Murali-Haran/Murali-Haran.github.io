Note for (1) Computing standard errors for a Monte Carlo estimate
for an independent sampler is easy. Since Markov chains produce dependent draws, computing precise Monte Carlo standard
errors for such samplers is a very difficult problem in general.

<br><br> Note for (2) Draws produced by classical Monte Carlo methods
(such as rejection sampling) produced draws from the correct
distribution. The MCMC algorithm produces draws that are
asymptotically from the correct distribution. All the draws we see
after a finite number of iterations are therefore only approximately
from the correct distribution. Determining how long we have to run the
chain before we feel sufficiently confident that the MCMC algorithm
has produced reasonably accurate draws from the distribution is
therefore a very difficult problem. Most rigorous solutions are too
specific or tailored towards relatively simple situations while more
general approaches tend to be heuristic.
