With money you can buy a house but not a home.
With money you can buy a clock but not time.
With money you can buy a bed but not sleep.
With money you can buy a book but not knowledge.
With money you can see a doctor but not good health.
With money you can buy a position but not respect.
With money you can buy blood but not life.
With money you can buy sex but not love.
