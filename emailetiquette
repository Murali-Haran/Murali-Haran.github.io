Some rules about email to faculty (though these apply more generally): <br> <br>

(1) Always address the person you are writing to: Begin with "Dear
Professor Smith" or "Dear Dr.Smith" or "Dr.Smith". If the faculty
member tells you that you can address him/her by first name
(e.g. John), say "Dear John" or "Hello John". <br> Bad ideas: no
address (starting with the message right away); "Hey" or "Hey John".

(2) When the faculty member responds to your question, acknowledge
his/her help with a quick "Thank you" email.

(3) If the questions are involved or would be difficult to communicate
via email, either make it to the faculty member's office hours or ask
the questions in/after class or try to schedule an appointment. This
is a far more efficient way to get help than to rely entirely on
email.
