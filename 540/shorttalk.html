Some general (slightly tongue-in-cheek) principles about giving
talks. Some of this is based on what I have observed over the years,
but a few of the points (items 1, 2 and 3 in particular) are based on
conversations with good speakers like Bill Sudderth, Brad Carlin, Tom
Louis, Jim Hobert, among others:

<ul>
<li> Almost no one really knows the subject of your talk. So start slowly, explain things as clearly as possible, keep reminding the audience about your notation and what you are discussing.
<li> Nobody cares about your research nearly as much as you. Do your best to make it clear why this problem is interesting and/or useful.
<li> Get out of the way of your slides.
<li> Stick to the time allotted to you. If you go over, many will be unhappy. No one in the audience will complain if your talk ends a few minutes early, even if it is an amazing talk. 
<li> <b> Rehearse: </b> Having nice slides is different from knowing what to say about them. The shorter the talk, the more you should rehearse it, and the less excuse you have to not rehearse it.
<li> Keep reminding the audience about the overarching goal, themes, ideas, and notation. Do not assume they will remember notation you introduced on slide 1 when you get to slide 8.
<li> Have a small number of slides. In general, aim for no more than 1 slide every 2 minutes. 
<li> Do not squeeze too much into one slide. If you say a few things on each slide, you will make your points more clearly.
<li> Avoid details unless they are critical to your talk. Try to give the audience general ideas; they can always ask follow up questions (or read your paper) if they want all the details.
<li> Do not complain about how you can't say all the things you want to say because of the shortage of time. By complaining about this, you are wasting precious time (remember your complaint?).
</ul>

Guidelines for very short introductory talks: 
<ul>
  <li> Have a checklist for what you want your audience to definitely get from your talk. Make sure that you give your talk so that everyone would be able to answer questions from your checklist. For example, for a computing talk:
  <ul>
    <li> What is the motivating scientific problem?
    <li> What is the computational challenge, e.g. is the objective function difficult to evaluate, is it a high-dimensional integration problem? 
    <li> What is the main idea behind the algorithm/algorithms you are discussing?
    <li> Do the algorithms work well? What is your evidence for this?
    <li> What are the weaknesses of the algorithms?
    <li> Is there theoretical justification for the algorithms?
    <li> What are your conclusions and recommendations based on what you have done? It should be apparent what *you* have done, as opposed to other work in the literature that you are simply citing.
  </ul>
<li> Describe the problem you are considering. For example, if you are fitting a model, do not immediately begin with a description of the model. Make sure you explain what this model is used for.
<li> If a data set is central to your work, say something brief about the data set.
<li> If the focus is on computing (which would be the case in a session/project in this class), explain the computational challenge and the algorithm you used. (Similar story if your focus is theory or a scientific application for a different course or project.) You do not have to go into a lot of detail to convey the central problem.
<LI> Carefully select what is most important and convey information about that; you do not have to mention everything you have worked on. This may involve tough decisions, for example leaving out things you spent a lot of time on, leaving out things you find interesting. The important thing to remember is this: if you focus on just a few things and you are clear, everyone will understand your talk better.
<!-- <li> Explain what is 'spatial' about the problem, or whether you are using Gaussian processes, GMRFs or point process methodology.-->
<!-- <li> Mention what method(s) you will consider (you can just list names of one or more possibilities). -->
<!-- <li> If you are doing something purely theoretical/algorithmic, describe the research problem, list any paper/papers you will be using, and describe what you intend to do (for e.g. what do you hope to learn from your simulation study? Do you hope to rederive/understand and explain a theoretical result?)-->
<!-- <li> You can write on the board or use slides, or some combination, depending on what you think will be most helpful for the class.-->
<!-- <li> If you are using slides: No more than 1 slide for every 2 minutes though you can have up to (but <b> no more than </b>) 1 slide per minute if you have some easily understood graphs/pictures.-->
<li> Please rehearse your talk to make sure you convey the most important information as clearly as possible within the allotted time (rehearsing such a short talk will not take up much of your time!). A nice talk will elicit useful comments and interest from the audience and is a good use of everyone's time. You can also rehearse with friends. They will provide useful feedback, e.g. they can tell you what they did or did not understand.
<!-- <li> You may choose to divide your talk among your project members or just have one person do all the talking.-->
<!-- <li> Pay attention to other students' projects --- you may decide to join their group if the project work interests you!-->
</ul>
