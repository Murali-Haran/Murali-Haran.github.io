<H2> Things to ponder before accepting a postdoc position </H2>
Postdocs do not necessarily make or break careers, but they can have a major
positive influence or, at the other extreme, be a fairly unproductive use of
your time.

When deciding where to go for a postdoc, you should worry about the
following:
Where have the previous postdocs gone (what is their track record?)
Who will be your mentor(s) ? How many other postdocs will they be mentoring?

How structured is your environment ? Will you have weekly meetings (a great
way to ensure that everyone is productive and on the same page)?

What (if anything) have former postdocs published during their time there (do
the mentors push them towards publications) ? 

Will there be specific projects to which you will be assigned ? 

How much time will you have for your own work (ask former postdocs about
this)?

Do mentors seem to care about your future career, or are you just like
regular employees to them?

How much teaching, if any, will you be required to do?

What component of your research involves computing - will there by 'payoff'
for all the time you spend computing ?
