Summary of research interests

Dr. Haran's research interests are primarily in three areas:
statistical computing, spatial modeling for problems in environmental
science, and statistical techniques in software engineering.

His statistical computing work focuses on finding ways to construct
efficient and nearly automated Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms for estimating properties of complicated distributions. He
has worked on ways to constuct algorithms that produce accurate
estimates quickly, along with some guarantees regarding the accuracy.

His spatial modeling work is motivated by research problems in diverse
areas including Geosciences, Ecology and Epidemiology. He has ongoing
collaborations with faculty members from each of these disciplines,
and some recent projects have included climate change research,
studying invasive plant species and space-time models for crop
epidemics. This work is, in turn, leading to methodological work in
analyzing large spatial data sets, using Gaussian processes for
emulating computer models, studying and applying spatial
generalized linear models, and more research in computing algorithms.

Dr.Haran's collaborations with software engineers have involved using
 statistical classification techniques to model failures in large
 software systems.
