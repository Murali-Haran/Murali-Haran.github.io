The following list of policies apply to all faculty, staff and students
in the Department of Statistics at Penn State. Please note that these
policies are an addendum to the ECOS computing policies, which
automatically also apply to the Department of Statistics.

(1) Home desktop machines: Anyone who takes a machine home assumes full
responsibility of the machine thereafter. (An additional short form will
be added to the existing Penn State form. This form will state that the
individual acknowledges that by taking the machine home, he/she is
assuming full responsibility for it.)

(2) Laptops: System administrators will help individuals with their
laptops under the following conditions: (i) The laptop must be purchased
by the system administrator (on behalf of the individual), (ii) The
system administrator will have sole root/administrator privileges on the
laptop, (iii) Requests for help must involve standard, work-related software. If any of the above conditions are not met, the administrator is not responsible for maintenance or help with the laptops.

(3) Portable devices are not supported by the system administrators. Purchasing and maintenance are the responsibility of the user.

(4) Purchases: All devices that are part of the department network must be purchased by the system administrators. If an individual wishes to purchase a laptop and self-administer it, she can purchase it on her own.  Also, if a device is purchased by somebody other than a systems administrator, it may not be allowed to connect to the network.  If there is any intent to connect a device to the network, the item will need to be approved and not assumed that it will be connected to our network.

(5) No Macintosh machines will be supported by the system administrators.  It is possible that in the future, support may be available, but at this time the infrastructure is not in place.

A general note (not part of the policies):
Information sharing: The computing staff are currently working on extensive documentation that will provide useful information such as names and I.P. addresses of printers.
