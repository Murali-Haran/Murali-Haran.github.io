<h2>Stochastic Processes and Monte Carlo Methods, Spring 2015  </h2>
<hr>
</center>  

This course provides an introduction to stochastic processes and Monte
Carlo methods. The course covers topics usually covered in a standard
introductory course on stochastic processes, including Markov chains
of various kinds, and augments it with coverage of Monte Carlo and
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Simulation and computing are
emphasized throughout the course.
<br> <br>

The course is divided into two parts: the first part (roughly 8 weeks)
provides an introduction to stochastic processes, while the latter
(roughly 7 weeks) focuses on Monte Carlo methods, including Markov
chain Monte Carlo.  The first part of the course begins with a review
of elementary conditional probability and expectation before covering
basic discrete-time Markov chain theory and Poisson processes. The
course then provides students with an overview of continuous-time
Markov chains and birth-death processes. The second part of the course
covers Monte Carlo methods. Starting with basic random variate
generation, the course covers classical Monte Carlo methods such as
accept-reject and importance sampling before discussing Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which includes the Metropolis-Hastings and
Gibbs sampling algorithms, and Markov chain theory for discrete-time
continuous-space Markov chains.  Course requirements include weekly
homework assignments with a mix of theory problems and
computing/simulation problems, as well as in-class and take-home
exams.
<!-- There will also be a midterm, as well as in-class (theory) and take-home(programming) finals. -->
<br> <br>
Familiarity with basic mathematical statistics and probability
(Stat 513 or Stat 414) is assumed as is some familiarity with
programming. We will be using the statistical software package R though
non-Statistics students are welcome to use a suitable programming
language of their choice.

The course is a required course for students in the M.S. and
Ph.D. programs in statistics, and is recommended as preparation for
advanced statistics courses such as Stochastic Processes-II or Spatial Models (Stat
597).
