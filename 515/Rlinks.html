<hr> <b> Editing: </b> 

It is <u> vital </u> that you use a good editor for typing your R
programs --- the editor will indent the code, highlight/color keywords
(e.g. function names), match parentheses, thereby helping you find
your errors more easily and making your code much more
readable. Debugging your programs will be a nightmare otherwise.

<i> For Unix/Linux: </i> I believe <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"> emacs </a> is the most flexible editor. It has the added advantage of also `understanding' latex, C, C++, python, and lots of other programming languages. <br> <br>

If you end up using emacs, you may want to try ESS (emacs speaks
statistics), which is a great environment for you to run and debug
your R programs.  For help on this go to <a
href="http://stat.ethz.ch/ESS/"> ESS </a> OR
<a href="http://ess.r-project.org/"> ESS (emacs speaks statistics)
within the R project website </a><!--  though <a -->

<i> For Windows:</i> <a
href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm"> Notepad++</a>
is apparently relatively easy to use and very convenient.  <a href="http://www.winedt.com/"> Winedt </a> is an option, though perhaps much less sophisticated than Notepad++

Also try: <a

Windows Frequently Asked Questions </a> <br> <br> 

For emacs/ESS, on Windows, try:  <a href="http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Companion/ESS/"> John
Fox's guide </a> may be a good starting point.<br> <hr>
<br> <hr> 

<i> For Mac OSX:</i> Simply download and use Aquamacs from <a
href="http://aquamacs.org/" > here </a>. There is no effort involved
in having emacs 'understand' your R and Latex code. Just call your
function `myfunctionname.R' for R or `myfunctionname.tex' for latex
and emacs will know that you are typing R code or latex code. Some
people use the in-built editor in R, but I think this is inferior to
using emacs/aquamacs or some other specialized editor.
