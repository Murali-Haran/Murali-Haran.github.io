Amal Agarwal: 29 
nice writeup and correct code. Missing acc rates; should have perhaps run the code for a little longer to get more reliable approx.

Meridith Bartley: 28
coding error for #1: -2 -- due to incorrect likelihood fn.
clear writeup

Gregory Bopp: 30
Great writeup, extra long run length of chains, looked at plots of data etc. Nicely done!

Geng-Yuan Chen: 29
Writeup was a little hard to read (-1) though it had lots of good diagnostics/information

Meng Chen: 29
no errors, good long Markov chain. Some missing information about tuning/acceptance rates. 

Yukun Chen: 29
some missing information about how the tuning parameters were obtained, acceptance rates.

Yunsi Chen: 25
-1 x 3 (errors in results): -3
chain not run long enough; poor coding practices (not taking logs, not enough information about tuning: -2

John Ensley: 28
#1: coding error -2
Otherwise, good writeup and seems correct. missing info about tuning parameters

Qingzhou Feng: 25
-2 mistake in likelihood fn
-2 missing info about diagnostics, tuning parameter selection etc.
-1 poorly written code/slow etc.

Mauricio Do Nascimiento: 28
missing information about tuning; code produces correct estimates but those were not reported!

Xiao Gan: 27
unclear writeup; missing info about proposal distr. -1
missing info about how to use tuning/proposal fn -1
inefficient code -1

Elena Hadjicosta: 30
No errors, well writen writeup

Dafang He: 27
2(e) is missing: -1
missing info about tuning: -1
error in code for #3: -1

Sandilya Kambampati: 27
problems running code (NAs produced) -2
errors in results -1

Wanjun Liu: 29
correct; some missing info about tuning parameters

Ardalan Mirshani: 29
correct and well written; missing some info about tuning

Jacob Parsons: 29
missing some info in writeup but code is okay

Justin Petrovich: 26
-2 for late submission
-2 for error in results

Sayali Phadke: 20
#1: error in code/likelihood -2
#2: error in prior -1
code not running -2
#3: missing -5

Abhishek Rao: 26
correlation and acc ratio calculation code are missing from R file: -1
#2: estimate is incorrect -2
#2 and #3: not a good sampler (too low acc rate) -1

Ben Sheng: 30
very well written and correct

Bradley Thompson:  21
3+3 (-2 for incorrect code, -2 for poor writeup/poorly labeled figures)
8+3 (-2 for incorrect code, -2 for poor writeup, missing diagnostic plots)
4 (-1 for not getting the correct answer)

Gang Yang: 29
missing info about proposal selection

Bing Yao: 27
missing info about tuning/proposals -1
#2: incorrect estimates -1 
Starting values? 
Maybe not enough sample length? -1

Zheye Yuan: 27
Inefficient code 
error in code -- acceptance ratio is off
missing info about tuning, starting values etc. 

Edward Zechmann: 26
error in likelihood function: -1
missing info about alg construction: -1
code does not run: -2

Ling Zhang: 29
missing info about tuning parameters/proposal. Didn't check acc rate
