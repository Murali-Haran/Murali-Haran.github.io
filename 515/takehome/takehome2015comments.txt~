nice writeup and correct code. Missing acc rates; should have perhaps run the code for a little longer to get more reliable approx.

coding error for #1: -2 -- due to incorrect likelihood fn.
clear writeup

Great writeup, extra long run length of chains, looked at plots of data etc. Nicely done!

Geng-Yuan Chen: 29
Writeup was a little hard to read (-1) though it had lots of good diagnostics/information



Bradley Thompson:  21
3+3 (-2 for incorrect code, -2 for poor writeup/poorly labeled figures)
8+3 (-2 for incorrect code, -2 for poor writeup, missing diagnostic plots)
