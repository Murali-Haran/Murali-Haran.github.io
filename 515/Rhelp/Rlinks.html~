<hr> <b> Editing: </b> 

It is <u> vital </u> that you use a good editor for typing your R
programs --- the editor will indent the code, highlight/color keywords
(e.g. function names), match parentheses, thereby helping you find
your errors more easily and making your code much more
readable. Debugging your programs will be a nightmare otherwise.

Look online for suggestions (I provide a few below) but try this page as well : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29"> wiki page for R </a>  <b> Always add a .R at the end of your filename  </b>

<i> For Unix/Linux: </i> my personal favorite is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"> emacs </a>, a very flexible editor. It has the added advantage of also `understanding' latex, C, C++, python, and lots of other programming languages. <br> <br>

If you end up using emacs, you may want to try ESS (emacs speaks
statistics), which is a great environment for you to run and debug
your R programs.  For help on this go to <a
href="http://stat.ethz.ch/ESS/"> ESS </a> OR

<LI> <a href=" http://www.sciviews.org/Tinn-R/"> Tinn-R </a>. Easy to install and it colors fonts nicely, but I am not sure that it does indenting/formatting well.

<!-- <LI> Even  <a href="http://www.winedt.com/"> Winedt </a> is an option, though perhaps much less sophisticated than Notepad++ or the others. -->

is apparently relatively easy to use and very convenient.

<i> For Mac OSX:</i> 

I have been told that the default R editor on Mac is pretty nice.
Another option: Simply download and use Aquamacs from <a
href="http://aquamacs.org/" > here </a>. There is no effort involved
in having emacs 'understand' your R and Latex code. Just call your
function `myfunctionname.R' for R or `myfunctionname.tex' for latex
and emacs will know that you are typing R code or latex code. Some
people use the in-built editor in R, but I think this is inferior to
using emacs/aquamacs or some other specialized editor.
