<P><PRE>Alone Again (Naturally)
(Gilbert O'Sullivan)

In a little while from now,<br>
If I'm not feeling any less sour.<br>
I promised myself, I'd treat myself,<br>
And visit a nearby tower ..........<br>
And climbing to the top,<br>
I'd throw myself off,<br>
In an effort to, make clear to whoever,<br>
What it's like when your shattered .......<br>
Standing in a lurch,<br>
In a church with people saying .....<br>
My God, that's tough, she stood him up,<br>
No point in us remaining .......<br>
I may as well go home,<br>
I decided on my own,<br>
Alone again, naturally.<br><br>

It seems that only yesterday,<br>
I was cheerful, bright and gay.<br>
Looking forward to, and who wouldn?t do,<br>
The role I was about to play.<br>
And, as if to knock me down,<br>
Reality came around,<br>
And without so much as a mere touch,<br>
Put me into little pieces.<br>
Leaving me to doubt, all about God and His mercy,<br>
Oh, if He really does exist,<br>
Why did He desert me?<br>
And in my hour of need,<br>
I truely am, indeed,<br>
Alone again, naturally.<br><br>

It seems to me that there are more hearts,<br>
Broken in the world that can?t be mended,<br>
Left unattended, what do we do?<br>
 What do we do?<br><br>

In looking back over the years,<br>
And whatever else has occurred.<br>
I remember I cried when my father died,<br>
Never wishing to hide the tears.<br>
At sixty-five years old,<br>
My mother, God rest her soul,<br>
Couldn?t understand why the only man,<br>
She had ever loved had been taken.<br>
Leaving her to start, with a heart so badly broken,<br>
Despite encouragement from me,<br>
No words were ever spoken.<br>
And when she passed away,<br>
I cried and cried all day,<br>
Alone again, naturally .....<br>
Alone again ................................. naturally.<br><br>
