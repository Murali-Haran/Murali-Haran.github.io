<h4> "Aaye kuchh abr" by Faiz Ahmed Faiz </h4> 

Aaye kuchh abr kuchh sharaab aaye <br>
us ke baad aaye jo azaab aaye .<br><br>

baam-e-miinaa se maahataab utare <br>
dast-e-saaqii me.n aaftaab aaye<br><br>

Har rag-e-Khuun mein phir charaagaan ho, <br>
saamane phir wo benaqaab aaye<br><br>

kar rahaa thaa Gam-e-jahaan kaa hisaab <br>
aaj tum yaad behisaab aaye<br><br>

is tarah apani Khamoshii goonji <br>
goyaa har simt se jawaab aaye<br><br>

'Faiz' thi raah sar basar manzil <br>
ham jahaan pahunche kaamyaab aaye<br><br>

Translation by Srivani Jade: <br><br>
"some clouds(indicative of cloudy weather) should come, and some wine should be served,<br>
After that whatever happens, whatever difficulty comes, let it come."<br>

"Moonlight should fall upon me from high heavens above,<br>
Bartender should come carrying fireworks in his hands" here wine is compared to fireworks..<br>

"Every drop of blood in my veins should light up like a lamp,<br>
and my beloved should come without her veil"<br>

" I was counting the times, the pain has been inflicted on me by this world,<br>
And then, I remembered you countless times."<br>

My silence echoed in such a fashion,<br>
I'm getting replies from all the directions.<br>

"Faiz", my destination was on my way,<br>
Wherever I reached, i returned victorious.<br>
