This course has three main goals: (1) for students to learn about
computationally intensive approaches to probability and statistical
inference, including Monte Carlo, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods,
the bootstrap, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, some
matrix analysis, and some select topics (time permitting); (2) using
computational tools to reinforce important concepts from probability
and statistics; (3) to develop fluency with statistical computing
using the language R.

<br><br>

Note that STAT 414 and STAT 415, the two courses that form the core
mathematical statistics sequence for undergraduates, are prerequisites
for this class. <b> I will not let you take this class unless you have
taken STAT 414 or its equivalent but I will consider allowing students
who are taking STAT 415 concurrently.</b> STAT 440 is intended to be
fairly intensive in that students are expected to learn about
computational statistics, algorithms and theory, as well as how to
write computer code to implement some of these algorithms.
