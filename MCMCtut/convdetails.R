Details for (1) Computing standard errors for a Monte Carlo estimate
for an independent sampler is easy. Computing Monte Carlo standard
errors for a sampler that produces dependent draws is much harder.

Details for (2) The MCMC algorithm now produces draws that are
asymptotically from the correct distribution. All the draws we see
after a finite number of iterations are therefore only approximately
from the correct distribution. How long do we have to run the chain
before we feel sufficiently confident that the MCMC algorithm has
produced reasonably accurate draws from the distribution of interest ?
