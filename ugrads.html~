<b> Some Information for Statistics Undergrads </b> <BR> </H3>
<LI> I have regular times every week where you can sign up to meet me with questions/concerns. Sometimes this is more efficient than email especially if you need urgent help. Here is an <a href="https://mharanpsu.youcanbook.me/"> ONLINE SIGN-UP </a> sheet for appointments. 
<UL>
<LI> If it is impossible for you to find a slot that works, please email me for an appointment. If you think you will need 30 minutes to talk to me you are welcome to sign up for two adjacent slots.
<LI> <i> Please note that to make sure that I will be there for the appointment you should book a day in advance (you can sign up 10 minutes before a slot but I cannot guarantee that I will be available!) </i> <br> <br>
