Aaye kuchh abr kuchh sharaab aaye 
us ke baad aaye jo azaab aaye .

"some clouds(indicative of cloudy weather) should come, and some wine should be served,

After that whatever happens, whatever difficulty comes, let it come."

baam-e-miinaa se maahataab utare 
dast-e-saaqii me.n aaftaab aaye

"Moonlight should fall upon me from high heavens above,

Bartender should come carrying fireworks in his hands" here wine is compared to fireworks..

Har rag-e-Khuun mein phir charaagaan ho, 
saamane phir wo benaqaab aaye

"Every drop of blood in my veins should light up like a lamp,

and my beloved should come without her veil"

kar rahaa thaa Gam-e-jahaan kaa hisaab 
aaj tum yaad behisaab aaye

" I was counting the times, the pain has been inflicted on me by this world,
And then, I remembered you countless times."

is tarah apani Khamoshii goonji 
goyaa har simt se jawaab aaye

My silence echoed in such a fashion,
I'm getting replies from all the directions.

'Faiz' thi raah sar basar manzil 
ham jahaan pahunche kaamyaab aaye

"Faiz", my destination was on my way,
Wherever I reached, i returned victorious.
