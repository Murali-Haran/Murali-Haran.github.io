<H2>Real Love </H2>

<P><PRE>Real Love
(John Lennon)
All the little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
All they really needed from you
Was, maybe, some love
All the little boys and girls
Living in this crazy world
All they really needed from you
Was, maybe, some love

Why must we be alone?
Why must we be alone?
It's real life
Yes, it's real

I don't expect you to understand
The kingdom of Heaven is in your hands
I don't expect you to wake from the dream
Too late for crying, now, that it seems

All their little plans and schemes
Ain't nothing but a bunch of dreams
All you really needed to do
Was, maybe, some love

####

(Alternative)

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone

It's real love
It's real, yes it's real love
It's real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

It's real love
It's real, yes it's real love
It's real

Thought I'd been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone

It's real love
Yes it's real, yes it's real love
It's real, yes it's real love...
