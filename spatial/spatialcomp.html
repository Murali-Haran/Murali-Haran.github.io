<b> R </b> <br> To install R and to find documentation and
packages etc. go to the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/"> CRAN
website </a>. Here are some useful R links: <a
href="http://www.stat.psu.edu/~mharan/515/Rlinks.html"> general R
links </a>. <br>  
To download any R packages, you simply need to use "Install
packages" under the "Packages" menu in the R gui or from the R command
line type: install.packages(package name within quotes) <br>
<em>Note: You can download and install R for Windows, Mac and Linux/Unix. </em>

<b> R for spatial: </b> <br>
The <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/geoR.html"> <b> geoR </b> package </a> in R is useful for a variety of basic spatial functions. More on this can be found at Ribeiro's webpage <a href="http://www.est.ufpr.br/~paulojus/geoR/"> geoR documentation </a> <br> 
The <a href="http://www.daimi.au.dk/~olefc/geoRglm/Intro/intro.html"> <b> geoRglm </b> </a> package. <br> 
The <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/maps.html"> <b> maps </b> package </a> in R is useful for mapping/plotting functions: <br>

<b> WINBUGS: </b> <br>
<a href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/"> WINBUGS software </a> which automates the process of running/fitting Bayesian models via Markov chain Monte Carlo. The current version is easily downloaded <a href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/winbugs/contents.shtml"> here</a>. <br> 
GeoBUGS is now part of the latest version of WINBUGS (1.4.1 onwards): It is a useful package for spatial modelers. For more information try the <a href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/winbugs/geobugs.shtml"> GeoBUGS page </a>.<br>
<em>Note: WINBUGS only works on Windows (hence the name) although OpenBUGS works on Linux as well. </em> <br>
<hr>
<b> WINBUGS and R: </b> <br> If the thought of dealing with R and
WINBUGS separately bothers you, you may try to combine the two with
the R package called BRUGS which can be downloaded from
here: <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/BRugs.html">
BRUGS </a>. This accesses <a
href="http://mathstat.helsinki.fi/openbugs/"> OpenBUGS </a> which is
an open source version of WINBUGS. <em>Note: BRUGS only works for
Windows although OpenBUGS works on Linux as well. </em> <br> I expect
the software to be stable (since the authors are also the
WINBUGS authors) but I have no experience with BRUGS or OpenBUGS
myself.  Please share any positives/negatives with me and the class if
you use it. <br>
Also see Prof.Carlin's page: <a href="http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~brad/software/BRugs/BRugs_install.html"> BRugs </a>

<b> spBayes: </b> <br> 
This is a brand new R package developed at the University of Minnesota
(the authors include two of the authors of our course textbook): <a
href="http://blue.fr.umn.edu/spatialBayes/"> SpBayes </a> <br> This
promises to do much more efficient and flexible fitting of Bayesian
spatial models. It currently fits geostatistics models but future
releases will include models for areal data as well.
