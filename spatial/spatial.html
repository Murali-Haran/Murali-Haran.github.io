<h2>Spatial Models, spring 2010  </h2>

</center>  

Spatial Models (Stat 597A) is a graduate special topics course
intended for students with a graduate level background in probability
and statistical inference.  Familiarity with basic stochastic
processes and Monte Carlo methods (as covered in Stat 515) will also
be very helpful.  However, I may accomodate some advanced students
from other departments who do not completely meet these requirements
provided they contact me ahead of time.  <br> <br>

Although the course will be focused on learning how to analyze spatial
data, several topics covered are of more general interest and
applicability, including Gaussian processes, Markov random field
models, point processes, Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo/Markov
chain Monte Carlo methods, and inference based on <a
href="http://www.stat.osu.edu/~comp_exp/book.html"> complex computer
models.</a> The discussion on Gaussian processes may be of particular
interest to students interested in <a
href="http://www.gaussianprocess.org/"> machine learning,
nonparametric regression and classification. </a> Post-docs and others
who want to sit in on any part of the course are most welcome to
contact me about doing so.<br> <br>
