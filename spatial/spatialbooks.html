<LI> <b> Recommended reference </b>: Schabenberger and Gotway (2005)
"Statistical Methods for Spatial Data Analysis" <br> A fairly
comprehensive book on spatial models for geostatistics, lattice data
and point processes (with the emphasis in the same order.) It does not
go into Bayesian approaches, which makes it easier to read and ideal
for use in tandem with the textbook for our course (which does not do
much on frequentist approaches.)  It is a well written book with nice
examples and connections made to basic statistical thinking. An
excellent introduction to spatial models overall. <br>

<LI> Noel Cressie (1993) "Statistics for Spatial Data" <br> This is a
comprehensive guide to classical spatial statistics by a leader in the
field. It is rather mathematical in places and is most suitable for
students with at least an M.S. level understanding of statistics. An
invaluable reference for spatial statisticians in spite of being dated
in places (it is over a decade old.)  <br>

<LI> P.Diggle and P.J.Ribeiro (2007) "Model-based Geostatistics" <br>
An excellent introduction to likelihood/Bayesian inference for
geostatistics, starting with basic geostatistics using Gaussian
processes and quickly moving to spatial generalized linear models for
non-Gaussian data. This is perhaps the book that is most closely tied
to this course, though it focuses almost entirely on just point-level
data. <br> <font color="#0000FF"> Geostatistics (and a brief mention of
point processes). </font>

<LI> P.K.Kitanidis (1997) "Introduction to Geostatistics: Applications
in Hydrogeology" <br> An applications-oriented introduction to
geostatistics. The book assumes no prior knowledge of statistics.

<LI> Michael Stein (1999) "Interpolation of Spatial Data: Some theory for kriging" <br> This is a
 theoretical guide to the theory, mainly infill/fixed domain asymptotics, for kriging.
<br>
<font color="#0000FF"> Geostatistics only </font>
<br><br>

<LI> Havard Rue and Leonhard Held, "Gaussian Markov Random Fields:
Theory and Applications" <br> This is a rather specialized book by
leading researchers in the area and contains a lot of useful ideas
(mostly from the authors' papers) on efficient computation (mainly
MCMC) for GMRF models.  <br>
<font color="#0000FF"> Lattice processes only </font>
<br><br>

<LI> P.J.Diggle, "Statistical Analysis for Spatial Point Patterns"
(2003) <br> This is a much more accessible book though it does not
contain the most recent research in spatial point processes. <br>
<font color="#0000FF"> Point processes only </font>
<br><br>

<LI> Jesper Moller and R.P.Waagepetersen, "Statistical Inference and
Simulation for Spatial Point Processes" <br> This is a specialized
book by two experts in the field of spatial point processes and
stochastic simulation. It has a very modern perspective but may be
difficult for first time point process modelers to follow. It may be
best to read this after reading the Diggle textbook and the <a href="http://www.math.aau.dk/~jm/NordstatPaper.pdf"> review paper</a> by Moller and Waagepetersen. <br>
