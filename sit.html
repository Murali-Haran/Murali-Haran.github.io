<H2>"Sit" by Vikram Seth (From "All You Who Sleep Tonight") </H2>

<P><PRE> 

Sit, drink your coffee here,

your work can wait awhile.

You're twenty-six and still have some of life ahead.

No need for wit, just talk vacuities, and I'll

reciprocate in kind or laugh at you instead.

The world is too opaque, distressing and profound,

this twenty minutes rendezvous will make my day.

To sit here in the sun, with grackles all around,

staring with beady eyes, and you, two feet away.
