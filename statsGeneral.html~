<LI> How political preferences distort judgment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/opinion/sunday/politics-distorts-judgment.html"> </a> <br><br>

<LI> De Veaux and Velleman (2009) 
<a href="http://springssoft.com/downloads/Reading_Journals/Essays/Mathmusic.pdf"> Math is Music, Statistics is Literature </a>

The idea here: it takes a while, and experience, to develop the
skills/thinking necessary to be good at statistics. It is more common
to find mathematical prodigies. (As to the analogy between math and
music, that's a shade more iffy. At the very least, I think this
refers mostly to Western classical music. Hindustani music/jazz has
fewer prodigies -- musicians tend to reach their peaks relatively late
in life in these forms of music.)

<LI> Daniel Bernoulli's work in the 1800s on <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jdlevin/Econ%20202/Uncertainty.pdf"> maximizing expected utility</a>

<LI> Daniel Ellsberg: Ellsberg's paradox (1961) suggests that people are averse to ambiguity. No utility function is consistent wit h the choice that people make.

<LI> What does randomness <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/12/what-does-randomness-look-like/"> look like</a>?

<LI> People aren't great at judging risks. Example: Lichtenstein et al. (1978) Judged Frequency of Lethal Events
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232557428_Judged_Frequency_of_Lethal_Events"> </a>
Hence, we should not rely on our "gut", better to use numbers!
