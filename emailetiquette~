Some rules about email to faculty (though these apply more generally): <br>

(1) Always address the person you are writing to: Begin with "Dear Professor Smith" or "Dear Dr.Smith" or "Dr.Smith". If the faculty member has insisted that you address him/her by first name, say "Dear John" or "Hello John". <br>
Bad ideas: no address (starting with the message right away); "Hey" or "Hey John".
