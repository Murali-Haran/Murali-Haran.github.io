Summary of research interests

Dr. Haran's research interests are primarily in three areas:
statistical computing, spatial modeling for problems in environmental
science, and statistical techniques in software engineering.

His statistical computing work focuses on finding ways to construct
efficient and automated Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for
estimating properties of complicated distributions. He has worked on
algorithms that produce accurate estimates quickly and with minimal
user intervention, while at the same time providing some theoretical
guarantees regarding the accuracy of resulting estimates.

His spatial modeling work is motivated by research problems in diverse
areas including Geosciences, Ecology and Epidemiology. He has ongoing
collaborations with faculty members from each of these disciplines,
and some recent projects have included climate change research,
studying invasive plant species and space-time models for crop
epidemics. This work is, in turn, leading to methodological work in
analyzing large spatial data sets and related research on using
Gaussian processes for emulating computer models, studying and
applying spatial generalized linear models, and research in
computing for spatial models. 

Dr.Haran's collaborations with software engineers have involved using
 statistical classification techniques to model failures in large
 software systems.
