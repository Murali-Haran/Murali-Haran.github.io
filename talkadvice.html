Some general (slightly tongue-in-cheek) principles about giving
talks. Some of this is based on what I like and dislike in talks I
have seen, and some of it (items 1, 2 and 3 in particular) is based on
conversations with good speakers like Bill Sudderth, Brad Carlin, Tom
Louis, among others:

<ul>
<li> Nobody knows what you are talking about. (Start slowly, explain things as clearly as possible, keep reminding the audience about your notation and what you are discussing.)
<li> Nobody cares about your research nearly as much as you. (Do your best to make it clear why this problem is interesting and/or useful.)
<li> Get out of the way of the projector.
<li> Stick to the time allotted to you. No one in the audience will complain if your talk ends a few minutes early.
<li> <b> Rehearse: </b> Having nice slides is different from knowing what to say about them. The shorter the talk, the more you should rehearse it, and the less excuse you have to not rehearse it.
<li> Keep reminding the audience about the overarching goal, themes, ideas, and notation. Do not assume they will remember notation you introduced on slide 1 when you get to slide 15.
<li> Have a small number of slides. In general, aim for no more than 1 slide every 2 minutes. 
<li> Avoid details unless they are critical to your talk. Try to give the audience general ideas; they can always ask follow up questions (or read your paper) if they want all the details. A caveat:  in many cases, you do need to provide some important details when the details are key to your work, for example important conditions for a theorem, sketch of a proof, or details about a complex algorithm. This can give the audience an idea of why your work is challenging (especially important for a job talk!) and, if done well, can provide some feel for the technical details of your work.
<li> Do not complain about how you can't say all the things you want to say because of the shortage of time. By complaining about this, you are wasting precious time, of which there is a shortage (remember your complaint?)
</ul>
